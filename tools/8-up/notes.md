# Notes

- Eyedropper tool in the tool menu
- Should the multiple menus be rolled into one menu and that menu have submenus for brushes, colors, and brush size?
- Brush shape menu
- Animation support

- Shake to erase whole thing? (make sure to keep main dot where it is at)
- Double tap to exit or press and hold?
- Should I be using the while true?
- Color the erase and brush animations dynamically so that the animations are never the same as the current color
- Should the current color change based on what the current color is on top of?  Or it could flicker
