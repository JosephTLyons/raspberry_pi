# Notes

- Shake to erase whole thing? (make sure to keep main dot where it is at)
- Double tap to exit or press and hold?
- Should I be using the while true?
- Move other classes / enums to their own files?
- Move project to its own repo and rename it to something else?
- Maybe extend it to be able to do animations as well (sprites)
- Color the erase and brush animations dynamically so that the animations are never the same as the current color
- Should the current color change based on what the current color is on top of?  Or it could flicker
- Brush size menu, this will require the canvas actions to be reworked, brush size should affect the erase and the brush
- Brush shape menu
- Animations and having it run them
- Should the multiple menus be rolled into one menu and that menu have submenus for brushes, colors, and brush size?
